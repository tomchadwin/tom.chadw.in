Several years ago, I blogged for a year or two about pies. Each post was a 
review of a pie I had eaten. Occasional gems stood out from a morass of 
execrable pastry.

The project came to an end in 2011, and I published the collected reviews as 
an ebook. You can buy [Pie Spy: Adventures in British pastry 
2010-11](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pie-Spy-Adventures-British-2010-11-ebook/dp/B01IW69040/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=piespyadvei0c-21&linkId=76f7ea0f97d3e3337750e6aad2742d6b&language=en_GB) 
on Amazon. I can't in all honesty recommend it.

<blockquote>Riveting, a <em>tour de force</em> in pastry literature!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>f you only read one book about pies this year, make it this one. A 
masterpiece.</blockquote>
