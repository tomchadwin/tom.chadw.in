    A few days after World Mental Health Day, I find it a no-brainer to 
    associate my own mental health with something green.

# Green sanity

My [esteemed colleague Leigh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-mclaren-brierley-80272236/) prompted us to embrace the colour green 
to raise awareness of [World Mental Health Day](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day/2022) this Monday just past.
This resonated with me. While currently owning no green clothing 
other than [my socks](https://www.moorlandhosiery.com/), I thought writing, not wearing, might contribute.

I don't know where it started, but green's always been my joy. 
Perhaps Dad's insistence that green was his lucky colour 
initially hooked me. He would wear a green tie on occasions when he 
hoped for luck, along with green cufflinks. I tried that with 
underwear on Newcastle matchdays. It worked as well as could be 
hoped.

These days, a couple of tangential greens make me happy. We were 
invited into [Greenhaugh Primary School](https://www.greenhaughprimaryschool.co.uk/) to hear the children read and 
sing for the first time since lockdown. [I've written about Greenhaugh 
before](https://tom.chadw.in/wrote/ShowUp), and while all of our mental 
health undoubtedly suffered in the fight to save it, the fight was 
worthwhile, and this visit lifted my spirits.

I used to play football extremely badly. Moving into the middle of 
nowhere twenty years ago (not to mention <em>anno Domini</em>) made this harder, and it fell by the wayside. 
I didn't realize how much I missed participating in a competitive game 
until I was asked to join the mighty [Blackcock](https://www.theblackcockinnatfalstone.com/) 
pool team. Perennially bottom of the league, the green baize 
nevertheless calls me, and I love the game.

But it's green in its common meaning which lies at the heart of the 
matter, of course. Someone once commented that one's happiest childhood 
memories are never indoors. Camping and narrowboating certainly rank 
among mine. 

Although I grew up a city boy, my wife 
persuaded me to move into the green yonder. While we worried that we 
both might struggle, in truth we've never looked back.

She had form. A short break as students had us walking a portion of 
the Ridgeway, from Swindon to Avebury via Uffington. Sunburn and blisters 
didn't dilute the joy of a slow journey through the English 
countryside.

We doubled down on narrowboating, and have been on the canals several 
weeks a year for over fifteen years. Landscape and nature are balm. 
Seeing HS2 carving swathes through the South Oxford summit was one of 
my saddest memories.

When I commuted, [a random tweet made me count up the number of 
waterways I crossed each day](https://twitter.com/tomchadwin/status/1354018739960901633).
That commute was of course a burden, but it was a beautiful one, almost 
running the entire course of the North Tyne. Getting Max the dog soon 
after we moved meant four daily walks, and inspired [another](https://tom.chadw.in/wrote/AWalkWithoutMax).

Many years of the Big Garden Birdwatch partially scratched the 
perennial itch for collection and documentation (I still delight in 
nuthatches, siskins, and the very occasional long-tailed tit), but I 
was happiest to compile [a list of every wildflower I could see in the verges of our 
single-track road](https://twitter.com/tomchadwin/status/1139896195965472768).

Mum said she once heard a professor say on the radio that she firmly 
believed that if you take an interest in the natural world, it will 
hold your interest for the rest of your life. [Maturin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Maturin) would agree.
