# Alan Garner

I read *The Weirdstone of Brisingamen* when I was ten. Like many others, 
fantasy was a passion for a time, and, along with inevitable Tolkien, 
The Weirdstone stuck with me. I remember little about it, other than a 
memory of darkness.

Many years later, I was lucky to attend a talk given by Garner. It was a 
storytelling event hekd in the reconstructed Anglo-Saxon hall of Thirlings 
at Bede's World in Jarrow. My older brother had been a Garner fan for years, 
but all I had was that vague childhood half-memory.

Garner's talk was like nothing  had ever experienced. It told of his 
experiences writing the then-yet-to-be-published short novel Thursbitch. 
I've never before or since heard someone hold the room so completely, as 
he dug us down into the earth of his new book. 

After reading it, I sought out all of Garner's fiction. The Weirdstone 
didn't stand up wonderfully well to an adult reader, and the other two 
children's books were similarly unmemorable. The Stone Book Quartet gave a 
glimpse of what was to come, int its peerless evocation of childhood.

The there was The Owl Service. I confess almost to having my breath taken away 
while reading this short book for the first time. The Welsh valleys act as a 
protagonist, perhaps emphasized to this English reader on the contrast drawn 
between middle-class English and working-class-Welshe. Class, and cultural and intellectual hatred 
soak every character, and I got my first glimpse of Garner's simply horrific 
perception of his childhood and adolescent self and his unwavering certainty 
of his own intellectual superiority. It's a tough read, but a compelling one.

The Owl Service is rightly remembered, of course, for how it sinks 
its landscape and protagonists through the fabric of history and nature. This 
is Garner's genius. Even in this early work, he creates echoes 
between ages, made concrete in elemental man-made objects. His is the liminal 
world between the natural and the unexplained. And that threshold is one of 
horror.

The Owl Service is everything which Jacqueline Wilson fails to achieve. It's 
a children's book about misery and anger. Red Shift takes these themes to another 
level for what we are now pleased to call a young adult audience.

Red Shift strips out the bucolic setting of The Owl Service, rejecting its 
beauty for the industrial hinterland of Garner's beloved Cheshire. The themes 
of class and intellectual snobbery infect one of the three narratives which 
run in parallel and intersect in this disturbing, upsetting, and raging work. 

Each strand distances itself from the reader quite deliberately in its characters' 
language. Modern-day irritating intellectualism, Seventeenth-Century Cheshire 
dialect, and US military jargon in the mouths of Roman legionnaires all unsettle. 

The multiple narratives allow Garner, quite astonishingly, to place massively 
greater emphasis on the echoes and touches between ages, again channeled through 
the ancient man-made. However, because of the explicit narratives in different 
periods of history, this frees this totemic relationship to become vastly more 
impressionistic. This conscious uncertainty totally succeeds in amplifying his 
central theme of inter-generational historic emotional resonance, and the book 
chills with dread.

The splitting of the narrative into three allows and requires Garner's overweaning 
evocation of place to sharpen and localize from The Owl Service's Welsh Valleys to 
Red Shift's Mow Cop. Again, the historic and man-made act as a conduit between ages, 
in the land and the ancient axe-head, which inherits the mantle from The Owl Service's 
megalith.

Red Shift is despair. "Not really now not any more."

As described, I read Thursbitch, last in this undeclared trilogy, before the other 
two. I was still buzzing with dread and fascination from Garner's mesmerizing talk, 
and full of expectation of land and dread.

Thurbitch pares Red Shift's three parallel narratives down to two. The present-day 
protagonists have continued to age with Garner, and death is constant. While hateful snobbery persists, 
Garner's characters recede, and his land looms ever larger. The Owl Service had the 
iconic Welsh valleys. Red Shift had a local curiosity and landmark. Thursbitch gives 
its name to the novel, but is otherwise unremarked, to the best of my knowledge. 
Its lack of historic or monumental significance 
allows the novel's landscape to drop all cultural baggage and creep its own quietly 
screaming path. The horror of The Owl Service's myths, and of Red Shift's history, 
becomes purely of Thurbitch's earth.

Again, the ancient man-made bridges the narratives and the ages. And the Seventeenth-Century 
Cheshire dialect, crisp and lilting in Red Shift, becomes rhythmical and beguiling in 
Thursbith. While the former's characters battled in extremis, the latter's chthonic 
archetypes mutter and lilt, "think on".

Treacle Walker is up for the Booker this year. To me, it was the faintest echo of the 
unflinching horror of this most English trilogy. If Garner wins, in my mind, it will be 
in recognition of these unforgettable books.
