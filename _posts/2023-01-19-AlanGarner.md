# Alan Garner

I read *The Weirdstone of Brisingamen* when I was ten. Like many others, 
fantasy was a passion for a time, and, along with inevitable Tolkien, 
*The Weirdstone* stuck with me for some years. I remember little about it 
now, other than a sense of darkness.

Many years later, I was lucky to attend a talk given by Garner. It was a 
storytelling event held in the reconstructed Anglo-Saxon hall of Thirlings 
at Bede's World in Jarrow. My older brother had been a Garner fan for years, 
but all I had was that vague childhood half-memory.

Garner's talk was like nothing I had ever seen or heard. It told of his 
experiences writing his imminent short novel *Thursbitch*. 
I've never before or since heard someone hold the room so completely, as 
he dug us down into the earth of his new book. 

After reading *Thursbitch*, I sought out all of Garner's fiction. *The Weirdstone* 
didn't stand up wonderfully well to an adult reader, and the other two 
children's books were similarly unmemorable. *The Stone Book Quartet* gave a 
glimpse of what was to come, in its peerless evocation of childhood.

Then came *The Owl Service*. I confess almost to having my breath taken away 
while reading this short book for the first time. The Welsh valleys act as a 
protagonist, perhaps emphasized to this English reader in the contrast drawn 
between its middle-class English and working-class-Welsh protagonists. Class, 
and cultural and intellectual hatred, 
soak every character, and I had my first glimpse of Garner's horrific 
perception of his childhood and adolescent self, and his unwavering certainty 
in his own intellectual superiority. It's a tough read, but a compelling one.

*The Owl Service* is rightly remembered, of course, for how it sinks 
its landscape and protagonists through the fabric of history and nature. This 
is Garner's genius. Even in this early work, he creates echoes 
between ages, made concrete in elemental man-made objects. His is the liminal 
world between the natural and the unexplained. And that threshold is one of 
horror.

*The Owl Service* is everything which Jacqueline Wilson fails to achieve. It's 
a children's book about misery and anger. *Red Shift* takes these themes to another 
level for a slightly older audience.

*Red Shift* strips out the bucolic setting of *The Owl Service*, rejecting its 
beauty for the industrial hinterland of Garner's beloved Cheshire. The themes 
of class and intellectual snobbery infect one of the three narratives which 
run in parallel and intersect in this disturbing, upsetting, and raging work. 

Each strand distances itself from the reader quite deliberately in its characters' 
language. Modern-day irritating intellectualism, seventeenth-century Cheshire 
dialect, and US military jargon in the mouths of Roman legionnaires all unsettle. 

*Red Shift's* multiple narratives allow Garner, quite astonishingly, to place massively 
greater emphasis on the echoes and touches between ages, again channelled through 
the ancient man-made. However, because of the explicit narratives in different 
periods of history, this totemic relationship is set free to become vastly more 
impressionistic. The conscious uncertainty amplifies his 
central theme of inter-generational historic emotional resonance to an astonishing 
degree, and the book chills with dread.

The splitting of the narrative into three allows and requires Garner's overweaning 
evocation of place to sharpen and localize from *The Owl Service*'s Welsh Valleys to 
*Red Shift*'s Mow Cop. Again, the historic and man-made act as a conduit between ages, 
in both the land and the ancient axe-head, which inherits the mantle from *The Owl Service*'s 
megalith.

*Red Shift* is despair. "Not really now not any more."

As described, I read *Thursbitch*, last in this undeclared trilogy, before the other 
two. I was still buzzing with dread and fascination from Garner's mesmerizing talk. 

*Thurbitch* pares Red Shift's three parallel narratives down to two. The present-day 
protagonists have continued to age with Garner, and death is constant. While hateful snobbery persists, 
Garner's characters recede, and his land looms ever larger. *The Owl Service* had the 
iconic Welsh valleys. *Red Shift* had a local curiosity and landmark. *Thursbitch* gives 
its name to the novel, but is otherwise unremarked, to the best of my knowledge. 
The landscape's lack of historic or monumental significance 
allows the novel's setting to drop all cultural baggage and creep its own quietly 
screaming path. The horror of *The Owl Service*'s myths, and of *Red Shift*'s history, 
becomes purely of *Thurbitch*'s earth.

Again, the ancient man-made bridges the narratives and the ages. The seventeenth-century 
Cheshire dialect, crisp and lilting in *Red Shift*, becomes rhythmical and beguiling in 
*Thursbitch*. While the former's characters battled *in extremis*, the latter's chthonic 
archetypes mutter and lilt, "think on".

*Treacle Walker* was up for last year's Booker. To me, it was the faintest echo of the 
unflinching horror of this most English trilogy. If Garner wins, in my mind, it will be 
in recognition of these unforgettable books.

*Walk and do,
Walk and do,
Walk and do
Till all is done.*
