the Border Reivers. Try it now on your desktop, before Flash finally dies for

## Ancient history: computer animation in the 1980s

In the 1980s, I saw a long documentary on computer animation on Channel4. It 
included many of the early Pixar short films ([Luxo 
Jr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G3O60o5U7w), [Tin 
Toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffIZSAZRzDA), [Knick 
Knack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qHfpr-yuCo)) together with 
extensive interviews with John Lasseter.

It also included a short section which described animating flocks of birds. 
This was based on the work of [Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/). 
The theory is that, while the motion of a flock of birds is fantastically 
complex, a bird’s brain is not. A bird must therefore follow a few fairly 
simple rules in order to fly in a flock.

If one could approximate these rules mathematically, one could build a group 
of objects in a computer animation, and program them to follow these rules. 
The idea of emergent phenomena realistically modelling nature fascinated me.

Reynolds managed to formulate extremely simple rules, and coded them, 
animating what he called [boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) — objects 
in a procedural computer animation which follow their own rules, resulting in 
the emergent phenomenon of realistic flocking behaviour. Here is the footage 
which I remember from the documentary:

## A poor historian, an adopted Northumbrian, and a frustrated web designer

Having always loved history, though having demonstrated little aptitude 
therefor, we moved out into rural (extremely rural) Northumberland. This is 
reiver country, and my brother, a fan of George MacDonald Fraser, pointed me 
towards [Steel Bonnets](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Steel-Bonnets-Anglo-Scottish-Border-Reivers/dp/1632204568), 
Fraser's seminal book about the border reivers.

A serial dilettante, I was interested in computers as a child, then in print 
and design from around the age of seventeen. I ended up working as a web 
designer from the late 1990s — as a completely new discipline, my areas of 
interest seemed to qualify me for this line of work to some extent, though I 
am no great programmer, and certainly no great designer.

My first paid job at a web design agency coincided with the launch of Flash, a 
web animation tool. I persuaded the company to buy a copy of the software, and 
ended up doing work for several clients using it. This was my first real 
exposure to computer animation, having previously looked at traditional 3D 
computer animation a little while at college.

I continued using Flash over the years, as I changed jobs several times, and 
as Flash itself developed. In recent years, and in this current job, however, 
I had barely had cause to use it any more.

## Reiver confluence

While walking [the dog](from:tomchadwin #max), I thought up the idea for a 
game which brought these various elements together: history, Northumberland, 
computer animation, and the web. I envisaged a game in which one had to reive 
cattle and sheep, which would flock realistically. Some searching online 
pointed me towards the work in Flash of Simon Man, who graciously allowed me 
to use his flocking code as the basis of Reiver. Without his work, this game 
would not have been made.

I got a working example up and running, but then decided that I wanted to 
crack another technique I had always loved, that of isometric 3D. The work of 
[Sulake](https://www.sulake.com/habbo/) in the early 2000s influenced my 
interest in this visual idiom. Having attempted to achieve a similar effect at 
the time with a colleague, I now looked to a book we had in the office on game 
design in Flash. The book had an excellent section on isometric 3D in Flash, 
and that set me on my way.

## Why game design is hard

I had a working isometric herding game, but it was very much a one-shot 
time-waster. I’d never really thought that this would not be enough to make a 
game in and of itself. I sought a lot of advice from varied sources as to how 
to change this one-level curiosity into a fully-fledged game — colleagues in 
this and other National Parks, family, and former colleagues from the private 
sector. Thanks throughout this endeavour are due to Steve at Presence 
Multimedia, former colleague at The Web Works, and Dave and Matt at Mere 
Mortals (at the time), formerly of Zebra and here at Northumberland National 
Park respectively.

In the end, one just has to think about it long enough, and something will 
occur, hopefully something extremely simple, and so it proved in this case. 
Pressure of time was added by gathering dusk, and levels were added by 
increasing flocks, reduced time, and larger buildings to raid.

## That was MY idea!

During the later stages of development of the game, Matt told me that Red Dead 
Redemption had stolen my thunder. If one of the greatest games of 2010 thought 
that flocking behaviour and herding made a great game, then who am I to argue? 
That various gamers evidently hate this part of the game is of only incidental 
importance.
