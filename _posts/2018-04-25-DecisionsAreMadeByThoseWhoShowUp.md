# Decisions are made by those who show up

Some of you will have read [my post about school 
closures](/wrote/MappingEmotion).

Yesterday, Northumberland County Council published their [report](http://www.northumberland.gov.uk/NorthumberlandCountyCouncil/media/Document-store/School%20Consultation/Education-in-the-West-Outcomes-of-Consultation.pdf) on the 
responses to their consultation on schools in west Northumberland. Their 
consultation proposed three alternative options. In each one, our daughter’s 
fabulous school was proposed for closure.

[I objected](/wrote/WeSayNo). We all objected. The school objected. The PTA 
objected. The parish council objected. The National Park Authority objected. 
We set up a petition to save the school, and <em>our daughter signed it</em>.

Northumberland County Council have abandoned all three proposed options, and 
now propose to keep Greenhaugh First School open.

There are caveats, of course: the school must convert to a primary, and must 
either federate or join an academy trust, but those are fights for another 
day. In addition, sadly, the Council report proposes the closure of Bellingham 
Middle School. Our “victory”, if we can call it that, is therefore undeniably 
pyrrhic.

However, we can now say to our eight-year-old daughter that when local 
government were going to do something she did not want, she objected, and the 
Council changed their mind. She shaped the future, and for the better.
