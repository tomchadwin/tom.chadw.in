As we all know, the ‘FOSS’ in FOSS4G stands for *free and open-source 
software*. Open-source advocates often rightly stress that the ‘free’ in FOSS 
means free as in speech, not free as in beer. These two meanings of free are 
often made clear by explicitly using the two words *libre* (free as in speech) 
and *gratis* (free as in beer). Open-source advocates often rightly 
concentrate on libre.

Open-source software is libre because there are no restrictions. You are free 
to do with it what you want. Use it to make money. It doesn’t do what you 
need? Change it. The open source of the software makes this possible.

But here’s the thing: *free beer is underrated*.

People like free beer. It’s beer, and — which is the key point here — it’s 
free. It’s something for nothing. It’s owt for nowt.

Gratis is what drives uptake of open-source software, not libre: to take two 
examples from my neck of the woods, 
[Northumberland National Park](https://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org/) 
migrated to [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), and 
[Newcastle City Council](https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/) have done the same. 
These decisions were driven by saving public money. They were not driven by 
the fact that QGIS was libre, but because it was gratis. It’s something for 
nothing. It’s owt for nowt.

As a rule, though — alas! — free beer is not free. The free beer at the 
[FOSS4GUK 2018](http://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2018/) party was paid for by our 
fabulous sponsors, and by our fabulous delegates.

That so much is done *without* money is astonishing, thanks to the enthusiasm 
and commitment of contributors. But without money, many things would simply be 
impossible, such as conferences like FOSS4G and, more importantly, the 
enterprise-grade performance and stability we enjoy in software such as 
[PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/), and 
[QGIS](http://geoserver.org/).

So, to misquote Sir Bob Geldof, 
"[Give us your FOSSin’ money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof#Live_Aid)":

- [donate](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/donations.html)
- pay for a [feature or a fix](https://www.geo-solutions.it/offer/geoserver-support/)
- contribute to a [crowdfund](https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/more-qgis-3d/)
- become a [patron](https://www.patreon.com/reginaobe)
- take out a support contract with one of the 
[amazing](https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/qgissupport/) 
[companies](https://astuntechnology.com/services/#open-source-support) who 
offer them *and who contribute back to the open-source projects they sell*
- [sponsor](https://www.osgeo.org/about/how-to-become-a-sponsor/)

This money drives quality and professional software. It pays for features via 
grants, and for professional bugfixing. Give what you can, if you can.

But you don’t have to give anything. You can still get owt for nowt. But if 
you don’t pay, owt for nowt is all ye get. You don’t get to complain, or to 
demand, or to expect. Complaints, demands, and expectations are tuppence 
change. If you want to complain, demand, or expect, pay an open-source 
geospatial company for support. If you don’t pay, approach issues differently:

- don’t *complain*, **contribute**
- don’t *demand*, **discuss**
- don’t *expect*, **engage**

If you want owt for nowt, ye divven’ get tuppence change.
