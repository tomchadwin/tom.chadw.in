The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)](https://www.osgeo.org/) is a 
not-for-profit organization whose mission is to foster global adoption of open 
geospatial technology by being an inclusive software foundation devoted to an 
open philosophy and participatory community driven development.

As a charter member of OSGeo, I'm happy to speak to anyone about open-source 
spatial software and help to increase its use across public, private, and 
not-for-profit sectors. As a member of [OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/), I'm 
happy to talk about FOSS4G UK, the national conference for open-source spatial 
software. As a [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) voting member, I'm keen to hear 
any feedback on open-source desktop spatial software.
