I wanted to ask whether OSGeo have made any statement on RMS's reinstatement to the FSF board. If a statement has been made which I've missed, I apologize. If not, is it something which is being considered or is under discussion? I feel it would be appropriate to comment, as many FOSS communities have. However, my own limited experience of broaching the subject on Twitter hasn't resulted in a very supportive response from those individuals who chose to reply (who happen to be spatial professionals). I am therefore very much aware of the apparent contraversy surrounding this issue. Anyway, I'd be interested to hear whether OSGeo is going to voice an opinion.
