I wrote a QGIS plugin which exports a QGIS project to a webmap, using either 
Leaflet or OpenLayers as its mapping library. You can find it in the QGIS 
plugins manager.

To request any changes, to report a bug, or to contribute to the development 
of the plugin, please visit the [qgis2web Github 
repository](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/).
